jndn-forwarder
==============

This project is a Java-based, minimal implementation of a forwarder for the [NDN protocol](http://named-data.net/); it does not implement the full set of features available in the [NDN Forwarding Daemon](https://github.com/named-data/nfd) but does provide the ability to route Interest and Data packets. Its design is motivated towards embedding in other applications.
